# Valentine's Day Page 💕

A cute Valentine's Day page asking "Will you be my Valentine?"

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### How it works:

1. The static HTML content is in `valentine.html`
2. The same content is copied to `index.html` for GitHub Pages default serving
3. On every push to the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/static.yml`) automatically deploys the site to GitHub Pages
4. The site will be available at: `https://nk1359.github.io/wybmvt/`

### Manual Deployment

You can also manually trigger the deployment from the Actions tab in GitHub.

## Features

- Interactive Valentine's Day proposal page
- Playful "No" button that moves away from the cursor
- Animated success celebration when "Yes" is clicked
- Fully responsive design
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no dependencies required

## Local Development

Simply open `index.html` or `valentine.html` in any web browser to view the page locally.
